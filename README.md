Binary Search Tree written in Javascript.

Script.js file tests some of the functions of the tree.

To use all functions, use binarySearchTree.js file.

It has functions like:

- `insert(value)` - inserts node with the given value in the tree
- `delete(value)` - deletes node with the given value from the tree
- `find(value)` - returns the node of the given value from the tree if found
- `levelOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree in level order
- `inOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree inorder (left tree/subtree, root node, right tree/subtree)
- `preOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree in preorder (root node, left tree/subtree, right tree/subtree)
- `postOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree in postorder (left tree/subtree, right tree/subtree, root node)
- `height()` - returns the height of the tree (longest path between root node and leaf node)
- `depth()` - returns the depth of the tree (distance between node and the root)
- `isBalanced()` - returns true if the tree is balanced otherwise false
- `reBalance()` - balances the tree if the tree is not balanced
